# Union find

Algorithms to check if two object are connected.

## Model

- Reflexive: p is connected to p
- Symmetric: if p is connected to q then, q is connected to p
- Transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r

Connected components: Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected
