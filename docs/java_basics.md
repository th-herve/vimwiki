# Java basics

## main method

Each Java program must have a main method. It's the method that gonna be executed first.

Every main method must contains the parameters `String[] args`.

```java
public class test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("hello" + args[0]);
  }
}
```

## Class

Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it consitst of classes and methods. (And no function, only methods attach to classes).

## print

```java
System.out.print("hello");
```

## Comment

```java
// single line

/* multi
  line */
```
