# Javascript variables

## Declaration

Declare a variable with the keyword `let` (or `var`).

```javascript
let myVariable;

let otherVariable = 3;
```
> Use `camelCase for the variables names`

## Constant

Declare a constant with the keyword `const`.

```javascript
const five = 5;
```

It is good practice to use constants to alias values difficult to remember that
are known prior to execution.

In that case use `Uppercase snake_case` for the name.

```javascript
const COLOR_RED = "#F00"
```
