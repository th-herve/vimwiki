# Javascript DOM

The DOM or Document Object Model is a tree-like representation of a webpage.

It allows manipulation of the webpage by a programming language.

Each elements is called a `node`

```html
<div id="container">
  <div class="display"></div>
  <div class="controls"></div>
</div>
```
It work like a family tree.

- .display and .controls are `child` of #container
- .display and .controls are `sibling`
- #container is a `parent`
