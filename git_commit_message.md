# Git commit message

## Good commit structure

[subject line in 50 char]

[body wrap at 72 char]

[issue tracker if any]

### example

***

Summarize changes in around 50

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  The blank line separating the summary from the 
body is critical.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how. Are there side effects
or other unintuitive consequences of this change?

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here
  
Put issue tracker if any:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789

## Seven rules to a good commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 character:
    - Hard limit: 72 char
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a periode
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 char
7. Use the body to explain `what` and `why` vs ~~how~~
