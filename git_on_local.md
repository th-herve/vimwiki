# use git on local 

1. in the directory you want to track 
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2. add the files to track
    ```bash
    git add <filname>
    or 
    git add .
    ```
3. commit to initialise a main branch
   ```bash

   ```

4. create a new branch
    ```bash
    git branch <new branch>
    ```
5. merge the branches, in terminal in the branch to merge with (ex: master)
    ```C#
    // in branch mater
    git merge <branch to merge with master>
    ```
